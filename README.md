# Simon Game Project


DESCRIPTION:
The Simon Game is a classic memory-based game where players need to remember a sequence of coloured blocks and replicate it to progress. This project is a web-based implementation of the Simon Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game presents a series of colored boxes that flashup up in a specific order, and the player's objective is to mimic that sequence.

FEATURES:
> Interactive Gameplay: The game provides an interactive experience where players can click on the colored boxes to replicate the sequence shown.
> Randomized Sequences: The game generates random sequences of colored boxes, making each playthrough unique and challenging.
> Progressive Difficulty: As the player successfully replicates each sequence, the game gradually increases the sequence length, making it more challenging as the player advances.
> User Feedback: The game provides visual and auditory feedback to indicate correct and incorrect responses from the player.

HOW TO PLAY:
Start: Press any "key" on the keyboard to initiate the game.
Watch and Remember: Observe the sequence of colored boxes as they flashup up in a specific order.
Replicate: After the sequence stops, click on the colored boxes in the same order as they appeared.
Success: If you successfully replicate the sequence, the game will add another box to the sequence and continue.
Failure: If you replicate the sequence incorrectly, the game will indicate a red flashup window with buzzer sound, and you can choose to start over.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML: Used to structure the game interface and content.
CSS: Styled the game interface to create an appealing visual experience.
JavaScript: Implemented game logic, sequence generation, user interactions, and feedback mechanisms.
jQuery: Utilized jQuery library for easier DOM manipulation and event handling.

Enjoy the game!
